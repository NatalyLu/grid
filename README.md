# Here are several modules with Grid layout practice

Each module contains one page only with html and css.

I wanted to practice with less and gulp, so if you want to run the code you need to take a few simple steps (you can find them below).

## Quick start

1. Go to the lesson folder
2. Ð¡heck that you have a version of node 10.13.0 or higher
3. And run the command <code>npm ci</code> to establish the necessary dependencies
4. Next build the project with the <code>npm run start</code> comand
5. Now you can watch my experiments with grid :)
